## Inspiration
Doop's Challenge is a clone of [Chip's Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip%27s_Challenge), a top-down tile-based video game originally created in 1989. Doop's Challenge clones the first three levels of the original game. Instead of Chip as the protagonist, it is the dog nicknamed "Doop".

## Assets
All of the sprites, music, and other forms of media were customly created specifically for this project. All assets are either directly inspired by the original Chip's Challenge or they are completely original works of art.

## About
Doop's Challenge was created as a side project to learn how to complete a proof of concept Unity game with custom assets. The concept was inspired by the developer's desire to create custom pixel art, while using their dog as the main character.
